# Challenges #6 - Emojify  
## Description

Popular services like Slack and Github allow for emoji shortscodes, meaning 
they will detect when a word in a sentence begins and ends with a colon (:)
and automatically replace that word with an emoji. 

These shortcodes allow users to add an emoji to their messages by typing a 
code rather than searching for an emoji from a list. 

For example, typing :smile: will replace that text with ðŸ˜Š
